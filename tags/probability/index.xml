      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;newthought&#34;&gt; The concept of subjective probabilities has deep implications &lt;/span&gt;&#xA;for how we think about betting markets, prediction markets, and even insurance. Rather than treating probabilities as objective entities with &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; existence, we can view them more pragmatically as prices one would place on certain lottery tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote cite=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST. The abandonment of superstitious beliefs about the existence of Phlogiston, the Cosmic Ether, Absolute Space and Time&amp;hellip;or Fairies and Witches, was an essential step along the road to scientific thinking. Probability, too, if regarded as something endowed with some kind of objective existence, is no less a misleading conception, an illusory attempt to exteriorize or materialize our true probabilistic beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
