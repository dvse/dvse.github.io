            <section style="padding-top:7px;"><p><span class="newthought"> &ldquo;Data science&rdquo;, in so far as the term is still meaningful today,</span></p>
<p>roughly amounts to &ldquo;analytics at web companies&rdquo;<label for="sidenote-5c6823f153e8f186f54dd27a929c2c77-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-5c6823f153e8f186f54dd27a929c2c77-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"> And of course victims of management fads seeking to emulate said web companies. </span>
. The
particular setting of course has an impact on how the &ldquo;analytics&rdquo; are
produced and consumed (primarily manifesting as greater degree of
automation due to volumes of data and timescales to generate results).
As more and more traditional industries adopt the software centric approach, however,
only some high level patterns can be discerned.</p>
<p>Specifically, &ldquo;analytics&rdquo; is the process where some manner of systematic
measurements and observations are used as a presumably objective basis
for making decisions, delivering process improvements or optimising
(more or less abstract) performance metrics. The same theme is repeated
with variations across a wide gamut of loosely associated disciplines.
Exact definitions have proven notoriously elusive, with few convincing
distinctions from the classical notions of rational or scientific
inquiry other than through the domain of application.</p>
<p>While even a few years ago there seemed to be a a good chance that &ldquo;data science&rdquo; might become an umbrella
term<label for="sidenote-5c6823f153e8f186f54dd27a929c2c77-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote"> Donoho, D. (2015). <a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf">50 Years of Data Science</a>. Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton </span>
for a partial rejoining of the many streams of analytics, separated
in some cases by nearly a century, it appears increasingly unlikely.
While the assesment is inherently subjective, it is difficult to detect intellectual undercurrents towards consolidation &ndash; certainly the academic world . It&rsquo;s indeed a challenge to figure out just who the intellectual &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; are. out a much stronger
intellectual undercurrent. With the large influx and no aca. Gian-Carlo Rota rather droll quip comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;When pygmies cast such long shadows, it must be very late in the
day.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What will then remain when the tide of fashion goes out? Below is a very imperfect attempt at grouping together various academic
sub-disciplines and professions (omitting actuaries) that could be
broadly said to be involved in analytics or data science and are likely to reamin independent for the forseable future.
The association is through a subjective assessment of closeness of intellectual tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Online advertising and website optimisation</strong> &ndash; online advertising has
grown into a massive ecosystem over the last two decades providing
revenue for the majority of online services. The nature of the medium is
eminently accommodating of tracking and analytics, resulting in one of
the more dramatic applications of &ldquo;data science&rdquo;. Most sophisticated
solutions (e.g. Adwords) are deployed by inventory providers and
aggregators, such as Google and Facebook. Live A/B testing is also
prevalent among online businesses &ndash; something which is still a rarity
in traditional enterprise. This is at present the biggest area of
employment for &ldquo;data scientists&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing quality control</strong>, statistical process control, lean
manufacturing, six sigma &ndash; this is an area of analytics activity
supporting manufacturing activities and has been progressively developed
since at least 1930&rsquo;s. Among the main objectives is monitoring and
elimination of variability in manufacturing processes (e.g. part
dimensions), ensuring that defect rates are thereby controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific management</strong>, management consulting, management accounting &ndash;
the broad idea of application of &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; principles to industrial
management is well over 100 years old &ndash; ubiquitous proliferation of
plans, budgets, KPIs and management reports is part of this tradition.
Very little attention is usually paid to natural statistical variation
in many metrics. Also while many controlled experimental studies have
been documented in this setting they have never become a part of the
standard methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Operations research</strong>, industrial engineering, revenue management,
mathematical optimisation, management science. Operations research began
as scientific study of military operations (e.g. convoy composition,
bomber interception protocols, logistics) during the second world war
and the principles have been exported to many other industries in the
following years. Main tools include mathematical optimisation,
stochastic processes. Mathematical optimisation is a somewhat standalone
area of research with many close connections to both computer science
and statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics</strong>, - really requires no introduction, perhaps the main focus
of interest in applications has been analysis of government data, polls
and surveys and support for evaluation of experimental results in life
sciences and medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering control</strong>, control theory, signal processing From
fly-by-wire systems to cellular networks and synthetic aperture radar.
Much less ambitious in scope than AI, but this systems work reliably and
are by now absolutely ubiquitous.</p>
<p><strong>Econometrics</strong>, mechanism design, causal inference (from observational
data) &ndash; due to the difficulty and costs of real world experiments in
economics, econometricians have developed tools and conceptual
frameworks for causal inference with observational data. Furthermore
mechanism design and the study of auctions have had significant impact
on the design of online marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Applied finance</strong>, financial engineering, algorithmic trading, HFT, risk
management. There are close parallels between data science and
quantitative finance in the 1980s and 1990s. This is not surprising,
because in market execution is a key part of any model driven trading
strategy, placing a premium on &ldquo;hacking skills&rdquo;. At present it is
perhaps reasonable to view majority of &ldquo;data scientists&rdquo; as &ldquo;quants&rdquo; of
digital advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Business intelligence</strong>, database / warehouse design, dashboards
&ndash;business intelligence is primarily IT vendor driven activity to
support management reporting in traditional enterprise with perhaps
strongest intellectual links to the academic databases research
community. Traditionally little attention has been paid to statistical
aspects of &ldquo;business intelligence&rdquo; or how it is to be actioned.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong>, natural language processing, computer vision, data
mining &ndash; machine learning is a branch of computer science that
initially focused on more tractable aspects of artificial intelligence,
primarily by constructing models from example data using statistical
methods rather than designing them by hand from general principles. Two
large application areas are computer vision and natural language
processing, including machine translation. By now the differences
between theoretical machine learning and statistics communities is
largely superficial, amounting to little more than preferences for
different styles of analysis of statistical procedures. Machine learning
research has also provided many of the tools used in analytics for
online advertising and algorithmic trading. Data mining has originated
from the databases research community and by now has mostly converged
with machine learning in terms of both objectives and methodologies.</p>
